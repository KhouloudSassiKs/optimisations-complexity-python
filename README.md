# Algorithm Utilities

This repository contains my **independent implementations** of algorithmic problems from CodeSignal.

# Algorithms Included

- **Optimized Replace** – Replaces each element in list `B` with the element from `A` corresponding to its closest neighbor in `B`, preserving the original order.  
- **Minimum Absolute Difference** – Finds the smallest absolute difference between any two numbers in a list.  
- **Additional Utility Algorithms** – Other small Python algorithm implementations.

# Usage
Import and replace the examples, call the methods to try them out.
